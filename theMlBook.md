### Unbiased Estimators

Generally probability distribution function(fx) are unknown.We conduct certain experiments,obtain some sample sets of x(Sx be one such sample set).
In this situation,we can never know what true value of statistics of probability distribution(expectation etc.) is but we can generate an unbiased estimate of it from those samples.

Assuming theta(hat)(Sx) be an unbiased estimator of some statistic theta(here that statistic(theta) can say be expectation value of that distribution,theta(hat)(Sx) would be the unbiased estimator of expectation value),then

E[theta(hat)(Sx)] = theta

In simple words,this means that ideally,the average of unbiased estimator taken over multiple samples Sx,would be equal to the real staitsic theta.In this case,average(expectation value) of all the expectation values found from those multiple samples would be equal to the expectation value of the real unknown distribution fx.
